# straw
Partial screen scraper with character recognition. Easy and rapid way to set an interface up with software that refuses to save to file or programatically interact with other processes.

# setup
Straw is presently only compatible with linux. It depends on tesseract to work correctly. Tesseract can be installed via apt-get

`$ sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

The project does not currently include build scripts, but it should be fairly easy to set up in IntelliJ Idea. I will respond promptly to any requests for support, and I welcome any contributions(Once the code is cleaned up enough to contribute to :) )
